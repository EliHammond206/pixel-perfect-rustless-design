      question: "The app is crashing. What should I do?",

    },
    {
      question: "Messages aren't sending. How can I fix this?",
      answer: "Check your internet connection - try switching between WiFi and mobile data. Ensure Rustless has permission to use your device's network. If you're in a low-signal area, messages will send automatically when connection improves."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Rustless protect my privacy?",
      answer: "All messages are encrypted end-to-end, meaning only you and the recipient can read them. We don't store your messages on our servers after they're delivered, and we never sell your data to third parties."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can see my profile information?",
